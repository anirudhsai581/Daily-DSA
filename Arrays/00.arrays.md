<!-- USE CTRL+SHIFT+V inside md file to preview rendered in vscode itself -->
## ðŸ“Œ Array Methods Complexities :
1.reverse Time complexity: O(n) as internally its similar to two pointer approach only, and space complexity is O(1)
so both two pointer approach and reverse works,when in interviews we can show two pointers approach.when in exams 
we can use reverse.

## ðŸ“Œ Storing index and value of array into object  :
    arr.map(callback(element, index, array) { ... }) this is signature of Array.prototype.map
    first value in call back argument takes element, next index(optional generally here we want),(third is original array its rarely used)
    { val, idx } is shorthand in JavaScript for { val: val, idx: idx }.
     In object order does not matter we could have writtern {idx,val} does not make a diff 
     Note here names of object properties are coming from {} not the argument names we used in callback of map, as they are local names ,(here they are same)we can change them like :nums.map((x, i) => ({ value: x, index: i })),property names will be value,index


Inline code looks like this: `const x = 10;`
