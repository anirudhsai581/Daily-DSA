<!-- USE CTRL+SHIFT+V inside md file to preview rendered in vscode itself -->
## ðŸ“Œ Array Methods Complexities :
1.reverse Time complexity: O(n) as internally its similar to two pointer approach only, and space complexity is O(1)
so both two pointer approach and reverse works,when in interviews we can show two pointers approach.when in exams 
we can use reverse.

## ðŸ“Œ Storing index and value of array into object  :
    arr.map(callback(element, index, array) { ... }) this is signature of Array.prototype.map
    first value in call back argument takes element, next index(optional generally here we want),(third is original array its rarely used)
    { val, idx } is shorthand in JavaScript for { val: val, idx: idx }.
     In object order does not matter we could have writtern {idx,val} does not make a diff 
     Note here names of object properties are coming from {} not the argument names we used in callback of map, as they are local names ,(here they are same)we can change them like :nums.map((x, i) => ({ value: x, index: i })),property names will be value,index

## ðŸ“Œ Converting a triplet array  to string   (in 3sum bruteforce) :
1. let triplet=[nums[i],nums[j],nums[k]].sort((a,b)=>a-b);
    let key= triplet.toString();//converts to "a,b,c" if we had triplet [a,b,c];
    //can also use JSON.Stringify(triplet) this will produce "[a,b,c]" if we had triplet [a,b,c];
    if(!(seen.has(key))){
        seen.add(key);
        res.push(triplet);
    }
2. set cannot store arrays it can only store primitives, becuase even if 2 arrays has same values there reference will be diff we cannot find unique

## ðŸ“Œ Initialising 2D array in arrays  :
1. we cannot set values of 2d array directly by defining an array , like let arr=[]; arr[0][1]=5; will give error because arr[0] is undefined so it cannot access arr[0][1], even if arr[0] was some number like=0 ,it will still fail becuse 0[1] does nt mean anything valid. so we have to have array of arrays initialised ,we may think of doing let arr= Array.fill([]); this will have a flaw all array elements are given same [] so their reference is same and updating one array of array makes updations in all array of arrays . So the best way to do is Array.from();
Array.from() creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object.
2.  `Array.from(arrayLike, mapFn);` //arrayLike â†’ something with a .length property (like an object {length: n})  
//mapFn â†’ optional function applied to each element  
`Array.from({ length: n })` :Creates an array of length n with undefined values.
`Array.from({ length: 3 })` // [undefined, undefined, undefined]  
`Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(0))`  
The mapping function is called once for each element (for each index).  
() => Array(n).fill(0) â†’ creates a new array of length n, filled with 0.
```
let n = 3;
let ans = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(0));
console.log(ans);
// [
//   [0, 0, 0],
//   [0, 0, 0],
//   [0, 0, 0]
// ]
```

Inline code looks like this: `const x = 10;`
