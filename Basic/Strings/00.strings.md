## 📌 String Methods Complexities :

1. Slice Time complexity: O(n) to rotate each time as we use "rotate = s.slice(-i) + s.slice(0, n - i);" to rotate string i times .so here time complexity of first slice is O(i) and second slice is O(n-i) together O(n).

2. Space Complexity of slice :Ex: "rotate = s.slice(-i) + s.slice(0, n - i);" O(n) as rotate variable storing concatenation of slices with cumulative length of n.
   if we had a loop and storing these in rotate for each i ,it takes O(n) each time but total only one O(n) space considered as memory discards and reuses after every iteration.
   we count only once.
   Also even if we didnt have rotate var separately and directly checked these in a condition block,still the space
   complexity is O(n),as they stll needs to be created in memory.

3. Concatenation Time Complexity: For string concatenation lets say adding (s+s) its O(2n)(sum of lengths of both concatenating parts ) as in JS strings are immutable so it creates new string s+s and copy each element so O(2n)
   which is O(n).

4. Includes Time Complexity :includes method compares substring chars to each possible position of main string, so worst case O(n).
5. split TC is O(n), join T.C is o(n) , sort O(nlogn) .also to sort lowercase and uppercase in dictionary order
   we use `arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));` similarly for other cases like when ascents etc are involved for diff languages we have variants in localcompare function we add by passing them as arguments too

6. String concatenation for n times worst case time complexity can be O(n\*\*2) as in JavaScript, strings are immutable.
   Each concatenation creates a new string of increasing length.(Some JS engines optimize this internally with a “rope” structure or buffer, but worst-case analysis is O(n²)). so in situations where you want to store linked list values prefer array first .
   Even if we want string , store in array then use join to store it as string this way its guaranteed O(n)
