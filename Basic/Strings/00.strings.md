<!-- USE CTRL+SHIFT+V inside md file to preview rendered in vscode itself -->
## ðŸ“Œ String Methods Complexities :
1.Slice Time complexity: O(n) to rotate each time as we use "rotate = s.slice(-i) + s.slice(0, n - i);" to rotate string  i times .so here time complexity of first slice is O(i) and second slice is O(n-i) together O(n).

2.Space Complexity of slice :Ex: "rotate = s.slice(-i) + s.slice(0, n - i);" O(n) as  rotate variable storing concatenation of slices with cumulative length of n.
if we had a loop and storing these in rotate for each i ,it takes O(n) each time but total only one  O(n) space  considered as  memory discards and reuses after every iteration.
we count only once.
Also even if we didnt have rotate var separately and directly checked these in a condition block,still the space 
complexity is O(n),as they stll needs to be created in memory.

3.Concatenation Time Complexity: For string concatenation lets say adding (s+s) its O(2n)(sum of lengths of both concatenating parts ) as in JS strings are immutable so it  creates new string s+s and copy each element  so O(2n) 
which is  O(n).

4.Includes Time Complexity :includes method compares substring chars to each possible position of main string, so worst case O(n).
