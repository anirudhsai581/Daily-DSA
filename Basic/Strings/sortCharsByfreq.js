/*
You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.
If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.
Input : s = "tree" Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]
Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
e --> 2
r --> 1
t --> 1.
The r and t have same occurrences , so we arrange them by alphabetic order.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10**5
s consist of only lowercase English characters.

//optimal : the following is optimal ,inline comments added , basically store freq in to array ,then new array 
// which is array of arrays where each element has an array of [char and freq] and now we sort by freq if freq same
//sort by alphabetical order.
//T.C is O(n + k log k) where n is the length of the string and k is the constant 26 for the alphabet
//S.C is The space complexity is O(k), where k is the constant 26 for the frequency array.

function frequencySort(s) {
        //idea came to store freq and to sort but did nt know how to sort (as we lose index and thereby cannot back track to char)
        //then from chatgpt got to know we have to use one more array with array of arrays char and freq mapped
        //then later got introduced to new sorting "local compare" on basis of some condition

        //better to use hash array than hash map as it will do slightly more
        //time for hash lookups.

       // now we need to sort based on frequencies we could have simply accessed freq 
    //   let say each element is a then a[1] represents freq and a[0] the corresponding character
    //so we would have passed sort a function like .sort((a[1],b[1])=>b[1]-a[1]) for descending

    //but when freq are same we need to sort them alphabetically so when a[1]==b[1] we mention special condition
    //a[0].localeCompare(b[0]) //This compares characters alphabetically.
