# Sorting Roadmap for Coding Interviews (DSA)

## 1. Foundational Concepts (Must-Do)

- Time & Space Complexity of sorts
- Stable vs Unstable sorting
- Comparison vs Non-Comparison sorts
- Built-in/Library sorts (Timsort, Introsort)

---

## 2. Basic O(nÂ²) Sorts (Good-to-Do)

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

_(Mainly for understanding basics; not used in real interviews)_

---

## 3. Efficient Comparison Sorts (Must-Do)

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort (Lomuto, Hoare, Randomized)
- Heap Sort
- Introsort / Timsort (concept)

---

## 4. Non-Comparison Sorts (Good-to-Do)

- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

_(Important when dealing with special constraints like small ranges or digits)_

---

## 5. Common Problem Patterns & Applications (Must-Do)

- **Two-Pointer Problems** (pair sum, 2-sum, 3-sum, 4-sum)
- **Dutch National Flag Problem** (Sort 0s, 1s, 2s)
- **Frequency-Based Sorting**
- **Nearly Sorted (k-sorted) Arrays**
- **Kth Smallest/Largest Element**
- **Inversion Count**
- **Merging Sorted Arrays**

---

## 6. Sorting + Greedy / Interval Problems (Must-Do)

- Activity Selection
- Meeting Rooms / Minimum Platforms
- Merge Overlapping Intervals
- Task Scheduling (deadlines, durations)

---

## 7. Advanced (Optional)

- Sorting Linked Lists (Merge Sort on LL)
- External Sorting (large data, disk-based)
- Specialized sorts (Shell Sort, Parallel Sort, Sorting Networks)
