/* Given an array nums of n integers. Return array of sum of all subsets of the array nums.
Output can be returned in any order.
Input : nums = [2, 3]
Output : [0, 2, 3, 5]
Input : nums = [5, 2, 1]
Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Input : nums = [1]
Output:[0, 1]
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 15
0 <= nums[i] <= 10**4

//best recursive way:same as powerset (push sums instead of sets)
//include once then excldue once for the current element explore all combinations when idx reaches n we have to stop and its a valid subset
//T.C is O(2**n) for the no.of calls as leaf is dominating and has 2**n and total calls are (2**(n+1))-1which is still O(2**n) and copying the
//to ans array is O(1). So T.C is O(2**n).

//timecomplexity:recursion explores all possible subsets in the worst case. For each element you can either include it in a subset or not
// â€” that gives up to 2**n possible subsets.Each call does O(1) .so total T.C is O(2**n)
//Every subset of the n elements is produced exactly once by this DFS. For each subset you make one ans.push(sum) call. The number of subsets of an n-element set is 2**n.So the algorithm performs O(2**n) pushes / visited nodes
//each call does constant work . so overall T.C is O(2**n).
//*** for calculating in mathematical equation form refer subsequence pattern notes. */

//S.C is The recursion stack space will take O(N).  if you consider the space used to return the output that the space complexity can go up to O(2**N).
//we are jsut storing sum its not dependent on length so no.of subset will be space complexity.
