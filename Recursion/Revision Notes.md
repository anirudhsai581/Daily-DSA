# üìö My Learning Notes

# üìå Basics:

1. Recursion: function calling itself. Types: 1.Direct recursion 2.Indriect recursion
   Direct: fun1 calls fun1 2.Indirect:fun1 calls fun2 and fun2 calls fun1
2. Base case is important in recursion otherwise we will end up in infinite loop
3. We have two types of recursion styles 1.Tail Recursion 2.Head Recursion
   1.Tail Recursion: recursive call will be the last step, In some languages this helps in TCO (tail call optimisation , which means the same stack frame can be reused for subsequent calls as no need of remembering func calls in stack once next recursive call is made)
   In JS we dont have any TCO and head recursion and tail recursion takes up same memory and time
   (but head recursion is little implicit , as stack carries the current state and while returning(unwinding) we perform the operations )
   In tail we carry forward our state with help of extra variables , more direct way of calculations.instead of backtracking like in head recusrsion
   2.Head recursion: we will still have some operations to be done after recursive function call is returned.
   (when unwinding calls(backtracking) the logic happens which returns to previous call and so on )

4. Every Recursion can be written as iterative solution and every iterative as recursive , problems of
   recursive nature can be written in less lines easily in recursive way compared to their alternate iterative versions thats why we use recursion.(In fact in husky and some languages we dont have loops and rely completely on recursion)

# Function Parameters in JavaScript

## 1. Primitives

- Types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`
- Passed **by value** ‚Üí a new copy of the value is made.
- Changes inside the function do **not** affect the original.

```js
function change(x) {
  x = x + 10;
  console.log("Inside:", x);
}

let num = 5;
change(num);
console.log("Outside:", num); // 5 ‚Üí unchanged
```

## 2. Objects (arrays, objects, functions)

- Passed as **copy of reference** ‚Üí both point to the same object in memory.
- **Mutating** the object inside the function affects the original.
- **Reassigning** the parameter only changes the local copy of the reference, original is untouched.

```js
function test(arr) {
  // Mutating (affects original)
  arr.push(99);
  console.log("Inside after mutation:", arr);

  // Reassigning (only local variable changes)
  arr = [100, 200];
  console.log("Inside after reassignment:", arr);
}

let nums = [1, 2, 3];
test(nums);

console.log("Outside after function:", nums);
Inside after mutation: [1, 2, 3, 99]
Inside after reassignment: [100, 200]
Outside after function: [1, 2, 3, 99]
```

# üìò Recursion Patterns ‚Äì Notes

Recursion problems often fall into **4 major patterns**.  
Mastering these patterns helps in solving most recursive & backtracking problems in DSA.

---

# Prerequisite:

### Subarray vs Subsequence vs Subset

### 1. Subarray / Substring

- **Contiguous only** (continuous block of elements).
- Example (array `[1,2,3,4]`):
  - Valid: `[1,2]`, `[2,3,4]`
  - Invalid: `[1,3]` (not contiguous)

### 2. Subsequence

- **Order preserved**, but not necessarily contiguous.
- Example (array `[1,2,3,4]`):
  - Valid: `[1,3,4]`, `[2,4]`
  - Invalid: `[4,2]` (order changed)

### 3. Subset

- Pure set theory concept, **order doesn‚Äôt matter**.
- Example (set `{1,2,3}`):
  - `{1,2}` and `{2,1}` are the **same subset**
  - Subsets: `{}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}`, `{1,2}`, `{1,3}`, `{2,3}`, `{1,2,3}`

---

## 1. **Subsequence / Choice Pattern**

**Definition:**  
At each step, we have a **choice**: either **include** the current element or **exclude** it.  
This leads to problems where we explore all possible combinations of elements.

**Key Idea:**

- For element at index `i`:
  - **Include it** in the current solution and recurse.
  - **Exclude it** and recurse.

**Examples:**

- Print all subsequences (power set).
- Subset sum problem.
- Target sum (count subsets with given sum).
- Combination sum problems (LeetCode).

**Complexity:**

- Time: `O(2^n)` subsets for `n` elements.
- Space: recursion depth `O(n)`.

---

## 2. **Permutation / Position Pattern**

**Definition:**  
At each step, we **fix one element at a position**, and then recursively permute the rest.  
This leads to problems that generate all possible orderings.

**Key Idea:**

- For index `i`, try every unused element at that position.
- Swap or mark used elements.
- Recurse for next position.

**Examples:**

- Print all permutations of a string/array.
- Generate unique permutations (handle duplicates).
- Letter case permutations (`"a1b2"` ‚Üí `"a1b2", "A1b2", "a1B2", "A1B2"`).

**Complexity:**

- Time: `O(n! * n)` (since each permutation of length `n` takes `O(n)` to build).
- Space: recursion depth `O(n)`.

---

## 3. **Divide & Conquer Pattern**

**Definition:**  
We **divide the problem** into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and **combine results**.  
This is the essence of many efficient algorithms.

**Key Idea:**

- Split input into halves or partitions.
- Recurse on smaller problems.
- Merge/Combine solutions.

**Examples:**

- Merge Sort.
- Quick Sort.
- Binary Search.

**Complexity:**

- Depends on the problem.
- Sorting algorithms often `O(n log n)` time, `O(log n)` space.

---

## 4. **Backtracking Pattern**

**Definition:**  
Used for **constraint satisfaction problems**.  
We try all possible options, and if one option is invalid, we **backtrack** (undo the choice) and try the next one.

**Key Idea:**

- Place a candidate.
- Recurse deeper.
- If invalid, **undo the choice** and try another.

**Examples:**

- N-Queens problem.
- Rat in a Maze (all paths).
- Sudoku solver.
- Word search in a grid.
- Generate balanced parentheses.
- Palindromic partitions.

**Complexity:**

- Typically exponential in worst case (`O(k^n)` depending on branching).
- Space: recursion depth = size of board/constraints.

# Permutation Generation ‚Äî Notes

## 1. Core Recursive Patterns

In recursion, there are **four distinct ways** to generate all permutations:

1. **Swap-based recursion (in-place)**

   - Fix index `i`, swap each candidate into that position, recurse on `i+1`.
   - Uses the array itself to track choices.
   - Efficient, less extra memory.

2. **Visited-array recursion**

   - Maintain a `used[]` array and a `current` path.
   - At each step, loop over all unused elements, mark as used, recurse, unmark.
   - Very intuitive and clean for teaching/interviews.

3. **Insertion method**

   - Generate permutations of `n-1` elements, then insert the missing element in all possible positions.
   - Pure functional style (build new lists each time).
   - Less common in practice, but conceptually simple.

4. **Heap‚Äôs algorithm**
   - Special recursive swap scheme with minimal swaps.
   - Often faster in practice.
   - Used in some libraries for efficiency.

üëâ **Handling duplicates** is not a separate method. It‚Äôs just an _extra check_ layered on swap/visited to skip repeated elements.

üëâ **k-permutations** (partial permutations) is also not a new method ‚Äî it‚Äôs the same recursion but with an early stop when path length = k.

## 2. Beyond Recursive Generation

If we expand outside recursion, other approaches exist:

### Iterative Methods

- **`next_permutation` algorithm (lexicographic order)**

  - Start with sorted array, repeatedly generate the next permutation in O(n).
  - Used in C++ STL.
  - Best when you need permutations in sorted order.

- **Iterative Heap‚Äôs algorithm**

  - Non-recursive version of Heap‚Äôs.

- **Johnson‚ÄìTrotter algorithm**
  - Generates permutations by adjacent swaps only.
  - Each step changes the permutation minimally.

### Mathematical / Mapping Methods

- **Factoradic representation**

  - Map integers 0..n!-1 to unique permutations.
  - Used for ranking/unranking and finding the k-th permutation directly.

- **Lehmer code**
  - Another ranking/unranking technique.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

- Rarely used for generating all permutations (output size is factorial).
- Useful for **counting** or **optimization problems** over permutations (e.g., Travelling Salesman, Hamiltonian paths) via bitmask DP.

## 3. Which Method is Best?

### General / Teaching / Interviews

- **Recursive backtracking (visited-array or swap)** is the most common.
- Easy to implement, intuitive, works well for small `n`.

### Ordered Generation

- **Iterative `next_permutation`** is the best when lexicographic order is required.
- Avoids recursion overhead, simple loop.

### Performance-sensitive

- **Heap‚Äôs algorithm** is preferred when minimizing swaps is important.
- **Johnson‚ÄìTrotter** when you need only adjacent swaps.

### Direct Access (k-th permutation)

- **Factoradic / Lehmer code** is the most efficient.
- No need to generate all permutations.

## 4. Analogy with Factorial

- Factorial can be computed by recursion or iteration, but **iteration is best in practice**.
- Similarly:
  - **Recursion (visited/swap)** = best for learning and interviews.
  - **Iterative next_permutation** = practical best for lexicographic generation.
  - **Mathematical mapping** = best for direct indexing.

# Recursion ‚Äì Permutation Pattern Problems

## 1. Basic permutations

- LeetCode 46. Permutations

## 2. Unique permutations (with duplicates)

- LeetCode 47. Permutations II

## 3. String permutations

- GFG: Permutations of a given string

## 4. K-length permutations

- LeetCode 77. Combinations (extend to k-length permutations)
- GFG: Print all possible strings of length k (with/without repetition)

## 5. Constraint-based permutations

- GFG: Knight‚Äôs Tour (example of constraint-based recursion)

## 6. Subsets ‚Üí Permutations

- LeetCode 78. Subsets (generate subsets)
- Then permute each subset (using LC 46 approach)

## 7. Derangements (recursion approach)

- GFG: Derangements (generate permutations where no element stays at original index)

- **Swap-based recursion** ‚Üí works for all 7 categories.
- **Visited-array recursion** ‚Üí works for all 7 categories.
- **Insertion method** ‚Üí works cleanly for basic & string permutations; awkward for duplicates, constraints, subsets.
- **Heap‚Äôs algorithm** ‚Üí efficient for basic permutations, but not suited for constraints, k-length, subsets, or derangements.

### Summary:

- **Swap** and **Visited** are the **universal tools** ‚Äî they can handle all categories.
- **Insertion** and **Heap‚Äôs algorithm** are educational/efficient in special cases but not flexible.
- Once you master Swap + Visited, you can solve any recursion-based permutation problem.
