/*
Given an array nums and an integer k. Rï»¿eturn true if there exist subsequences such that the sum of all elements in subsequences is equal to
 k else false.
Input : nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , k = 8 Output : Yes
Explanation : The subsequences like [1, 2, 5] , [1, 3, 4] , [3, 5] sum up to 8.
Input : nums = [4, 3, 9, 2] , k = 10 Output : No
Explanation : No subsequence can sum up to 10.
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 20
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 2000

optimal:
same as powerset instead of pushing all to ans array,we check sum if atleast one sum found we just return the remaining calls directly with help of
boolean.

using for loop backtracking(dfs like algo)
like following but we track sum instead of curr, (also remember we need to remove nums[i] from sum in  backtrack if we are doing explicit add like before recursion 
if we do sum+=nums[i] as for remaining iterations of the loop sum will not be correct )if we directly modfiy and pass in recursion its not need(as pass by value)
//we generate suppose nums=[a,b,c]  ans array will be : [[],[a],[a,b],[a,b,c],[a,c],[b],[b,c],[c]]
  //we go with index full depth pushing the curr each time , once we reach end, we pop and backtrack , then we push next index and along with it 
  //all its next ones once we reach end of this we backtrack and start with next index go full again
  // this is kind of including everything with curr index as start with nested loops ensuring we move (excluding the next one) 
  // Time Complexity: O(n*2**n) S.C is    mix of output size which is O(n*2**n) + extra space which is O(n) (call stack depth O(n)+temporrary curr uses O(n))
overall space complexity is O(n*2**n).
