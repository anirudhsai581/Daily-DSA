/* Given an array nums and an integer k.Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of all
elements in the subsequence is equal to k.
Input : nums = [4, 9, 2, 5, 1] , k = 10
Output : 2 
Input : nums = [4, 2, 10, 5, 1, 3] , k = 5
Output : 3
Input : nums = [1, 10, 4, 5] , k = 16
Output:1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 20
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 2000
